A web-based dashboard for software analysis and visualization using software artifacts' data scanned by jQAssistant. This [screencast](https://youtu.be/LebVqfzQ_KE) shows how to scan, analyze, and visualize software artifacts' data with the open source stack (jQAssistant, Neo4j, React, D3).

## Prerequisites ##

The dashboard requires a Neo4j database where the information of the software to be analyzed has been imported with jQAssistant.
There are three possibilities how to achieve this. You can use jQAssistant to extract the data of your software project as described [here](https://jqassistant.org/get-started/). Alternatively, you can use one of the [pre-built Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard/tags/) containing a Neo4j server with sample data ([spring-petclinic](https://github.com/buschmais/spring-petclinic/tree/master) or [jUnit](https://github.com/jqassistant-demo/junit4/tree/jqassistant/vissoft-2018)). Or you import the dumps provided in the [data directory](https://github.com/softvis-research/jqa-dashboard/tree/master/data) directly into your Neo4j database with the following command.

```
$ neo4j-admin load --from=<path-to-neo4j-dump> [--force=true]
```

## Installation ##

Clone the repository and execute the following command.

```
$ npm run install-dashboard
```

After installation you can run the dashboard by executing this command.

```
$ npm run dashboard
```

## Update ##

For updating all packages and dependencies after running git pull you can execute this command.

```
$ npm run update-dashboard
```

## Docker ##

The dashboard can also be run via Docker. Therefore, you can use these [pre-built Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard/tags/).

```
$ docker pull visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard:dashboard
$ docker run -it -p 3000:3000 visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard:dashboard
```

If needed, you can use one of these commands to additionally run a Neo4j server with sample data already loaded.

```
$ docker pull visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard:neo4j-junit
$ docker run -it -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard:neo4j-junit
```

or

```
$ docker pull visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard:neo4j-petclinic
$ docker run -it -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 visualsoftwareanalytics/jqa-dashboard:neo4j-petclinic
```
