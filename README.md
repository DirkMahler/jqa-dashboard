## Developers ##

To prevent "FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory" when recompiling often you have to increase max_old_space_size.

```
$ npm install -g increase-memory-limit
$ increase-memory-limit
```

Before committing new visualizations please run all tests and check if all tests pass.
