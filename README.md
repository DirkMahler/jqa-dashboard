A web-based dashboard for software analysis and visualization using software artifacts' data scanned by jQAssistant. This [screencast](https://youtu.be/LebVqfzQ_KE) shows how to scan, analyze, and visualize software artifacts' data with the open source stack (jQAssistant, Neo4j, React, D3).

## Prerequisites ##

The dashboard requires a Neo4j database where the information of the software to be analyzed has been imported with jQAssistant.
To extract the data of a software project using jQAssistant and import it into Neo4j, follow the instructions on [jQAssistant - Get Started](https://jqassistant.org/get-started/). Alternatively, one of the sample project dumps ([spring-petclinic](https://github.com/buschmais/spring-petclinic/tree/master) or [jUnit](https://github.com/jqassistant-demo/junit4/tree/jqassistant/vissoft-2018)) stored in the data directory of this repository can be imported directly into Neo4j with the following command.

```
$ neo4j-admin load --from=<path-to-neo4j-dump> [--force=true]
```

Further information on importing Neo4j dumps is provided [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/dump-load/).
## Installation ##

Clone the repository and execute the following command.

```
$ npm run install-dashboard
```

After installation you can run the dashboard by executing this command.

```
$ npm run dashboard
```

## Update ##

For updating all packages and dependencies after running git pull you can execute this command.

```
$ npm run update-dashboard
```

## Developers ##

To prevent "FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory" when recompiling often you have to increase max_old_space_size.

```
$ npm install -g increase-memory-limit
$ increase-memory-limit
```

Before committing new visualizations please run all tests and check if all tests pass.

```
$ npm run test
```
